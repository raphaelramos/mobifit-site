          "question": "Are the videos generated by AI?",

        },
        {
          "question": "When should I use \"Log Activity\"?",

        {
          "question": "How is the challenge ranking calculated?",
          "answer": "The ranking can be viewed by \"active days\" or \"total check-ins\". If you make two posts on the same day, that counts as two check-ins but only one active day."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I create and configure challenges to engage students?",
          "answer": "As a group administrator, go to settings and enable the challenge option. Set the start and end dates for the period you want to track. You can also require a photo for posts, which forces participants to include an image in their check-ins and increases commitment."

        {
          "question": "How does photo sharing work?",

        },
        {
          "question": "How does sharing workouts with students work?",
          "answer": "You can share a personalized workout with all members of a group or send it directly to a specific student. When shared with a group, the workout appears in the group's \"Workouts\" menu and each student can add it manually to their \"My Workouts\" list. If sent directly to a student, it appears automatically in their app under \"My Workouts\" in the \"Content\" tab."

        {
          "question": "Do I need to be in the same group as my student to share workouts?",
          "answer": "Yes. All interactive features use groups. Workout sharing is only possible between people in the same group. Create a group, send the invite link to your students, and once they join you can share workouts."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is an anamnesis and how do I use it with my students?",
          "answer": "An anamnesis is a space where your students can submit personal information relevant to their follow-up. This data is visible only to group administrators, allowing you to keep an organized history for each student, including health information, goals, limitations and other notes important for workout prescription."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I track students' performance in challenges?",
          "answer": "In the group's ranking menu you can view all members' participation. The system allows switching between views by active days or total check-ins, and filtering by different periods: current week, month, year or all time. A progress bar shows the challenge's progress relative to the defined period."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I have multiple groups for different classes of students?",
          "answer": "Yes. You can create and manage multiple groups, each with its own settings, challenges and shared workouts."
