## About MobiFit

Mobifit is an app focused on training and tracking dedication and progress, integrating local-first functionality, edge functions, AI, gamification, and a fully unlocked journey â€” without requiring login, forms, or permissions for most features.

The core experience revolves around projects, which are daily challenges with a start and end date. Users are required to check in at the time of day they dedicate to their project. Projects can be individual or group-based.

### Features
- Groups: Allow members to post updates, view participant rankings, and access exclusive content.

- Offline: The local-first approach ensures all data is saved locally and synced to the cloud only for backup or synchronization with other devices. This guarantees that the main functionalities work entirely offline. If users choose not to log in, their data remains private.

- Workout Library: Offers training suggestions with guidance in the form of images, videos, and text created by certified professionals.

- AI: Integrated with the app's media database to showcase proper exercise execution.
